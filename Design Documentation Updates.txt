New Classes:
- Trie && TrieNode
    Data structure used by dictionary to efficiently store strings optimized for finding and adding

- Pair<X, Y>
    Simple way to store locations, mentioned on prior Diagram but not defined

- CorrectionCase
    Stores state of a single condition to make it easier to check if a state is ignored

- Listener
    Decides when to automatically check for corrections again



Other Notes:
- Added seperate thread for running correctons, managed by TextDisplay
- File paths removed from File functions, now file paths are chosen within the File functions.
- Removed unused functions such as Correction.CheckCapitalization() and Dictionary.ReloadDictionary()
- Added more detail to whole diagram
